# data_science_tools_and_resources

This repository holds tools and resources related to data science. 

One will find:
- Tutorials, both developed by myself and the most useful developed elsewhere
- Links to the best materials across the web
- General information to guide data science education, development, and action
- A fluid list of references that are relevant to machine learning applications in the space sciences (primarily Heliophysics)

Note that most of the information is held in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/data_science_tools_and_resources/wiki)
